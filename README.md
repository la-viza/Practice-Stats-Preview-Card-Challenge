## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned

This is my first project that I've built using SASS /SCSS. Since I only worked with CSS-Flexbox and Bootstrap framework before, it was challenging to completely switch to a new approach and build everything from scratch. Therefore, the code turned out to be not as clean as I wish it to be. Usually, I try to maintain my code much neater and shorter! Nevertheless, I like to experiment and found the entire process very rewarding. Overall, I'm glad about the final result!
