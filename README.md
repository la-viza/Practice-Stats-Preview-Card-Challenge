## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned

This is my first project that I've built using SASS and CSS-Grid System. Since I only worked with CSS-Flexbox and Bootstrap framework before, it was challenging to comletely swicth to knew approach
build everything from the scratch. Therefore, the code turned out to be not as clean as I wish it to be. And, even though, I prefer to use CSS-Flexbox over Grid, I still found the process very rewarding and I'm glad with a final result!
